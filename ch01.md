# Chapter 01: What Ever Are We Doing?

## Introductions

Hi there! I'm Professor Franklin Frisby. Pleased to make your acquaintance. We'll be spending some time together, as I'm supposed to teach you a bit about functional programming. But enough about me, what about you? I'm hoping that you're at least a bit familiar with the JavaScript language, have a teensy bit of Object-Oriented experience, and fancy yourself a working class programmer. You don't need to have a PhD in Entomology, you just need to know how to find and kill some bugs.

I won't assume that you have any previous functional programming knowledge, because we both know what happens when you assume. I will, however, expect you to have run into some of the unfavorable situations that arise when working with mutable state, unrestricted side effects, and unprincipled design. Now that we've been properly introduced, let's get on with it.

我不会猜想你之前是否有函数式编程的知识，因为猜测是没有意义的。但是我希望您曾经碰到过mutable state, unrestricted side effects, and unprincipled design带来的问题。那现在让我们重新认识下他们。 

The purpose of this chapter is to give you a feel for what we're after when we write functional programs. In order to be able to understand the following chapters, we must have some idea about what makes a program *functional*. Otherwise we'll find ourselves scribbling aimlessly, avoiding objects at all costs - a clumsy endeavor indeed. We need a clear bullseye to hurl our code at, some celestial compass for when the waters get rough.

本章的主旨在于当你使用函数式编程的时候给你一种新的体会。为了更好的理解后面的章节，我们需要了解是什么让程序变成函数式。否则，就会发现我们其实是不惜一切代价地避开对象的一顿乱写——这种努力是不可取的。

Now, there are some general programming principles - various acronymic credos that guide us through the dark tunnels of any application: DRY (don't repeat yourself), YAGNI (ya ain't gonna need it), loose coupling high cohesion, the principle of least surprise, single responsibility, and so on.

目前， 有一些通用的编程原则（一些首字母的缩写指引我们通过程序中最黑暗的时刻）：DRY（不做重复的事）， YAGNI（适可而止），松耦合、高内聚、最小意外原则、单一责任等等

I won't belabor you by listing each and every guideline I've heard throughout the years... The point of the matter is that they hold up in a functional setting, although they're merely tangential to our ultimate goal. What I'd like you to get a feel for now, before we get any further, is our intention when we poke and prod at the keyboard; our functional Xanadu.

我不想把这些年来我听到的每一条指导原则都一一列举出来，来反复讨论。但是重点在于他们同样适用于函数式，尽管它们跟我们的目标好不搭嘎。在进一步了解之前，我希望明白我们敲击键盘的意图： 函数式Xanadu

## A Brief Encounter

Let's start with a touch of insanity. Here is a seagull application. When flocks conjoin they become a larger flock, and when they breed, they increase by the number of seagulls with whom they're breeding. Now, this is not intended to be good Object-Oriented code, mind you, it is here to highlight the perils of our modern, assignment based approach. Behold:

我们从一段神奇的代码开始。这是一个关于海鸥的应用程序。当海鸥群汇合时，它们变成较大的海鸥群，当它们繁殖时，与之繁殖的海鸥数量的增加而增加。 下面是一段并不是很完整的面向对象的代码，它主要展示模型基于赋值方法的危险。请看

```js
class Flock {
  constructor(n) {
    this.seagulls = n;
  }

  conjoin(other) {
    this.seagulls += other.seagulls;
    return this;
  }

  breed(other) {
    this.seagulls = this.seagulls * other.seagulls;
    return this;
  }
}

const flockA = new Flock(4);
const flockB = new Flock(2);
const flockC = new Flock(0);
const result = flockA
  .conjoin(flockC)
  .breed(flockB)
  .conjoin(flockA.breed(flockB))
  .seagulls;
// 32
```

Who on earth would craft such a ghastly abomination? It is unreasonably difficult to keep track of the mutating internal state. And, good heavens, the answer is even incorrect! It should have been `16`, but `flockA` wound up permanently altered in the process. Poor `flockA`. This is anarchy in the I.T.! This is wild animal arithmetic!

到底有谁会制造出如此可怕的恐怖之物？跟踪内部状态的改变是及其困难的。但是答案竟然跟我们预期的天壤之别。我们推断的答案应该是16，可怜的`flockA`在过程中竟然被神奇的改变了。 这是IT届的混乱现象，这是一个野蛮的算术。

If you don't understand this program, it's okay, neither do I. The point to remember here is that state and mutable values are hard to follow, even in such a small example. 

如果你不理解这段程序，没有关系，我也不理解。关键在于记住即使在这么短小的程序里，状态和改变的值是很难跟踪的， 

Let's try again, this time using a more functional approach:

让我们使用一些函数式的方法再来一遍。

```js
const conjoin = (flockX, flockY) => flockX + flockY;
const breed = (flockX, flockY) => flockX * flockY;

const flockA = 4;
const flockB = 2;
const flockC = 0;
const result =
    conjoin(breed(flockB, conjoin(flockA, flockC)), breed(flockA, flockB));
// 16
```

Well, this time we got the right answer. With much less code. The function nesting is a tad confusing... (we'll remedy this situation in ch5). It's better, but let's dig a little bit deeper. There are benefits to calling a spade a spade. Had we scrutinized our custom functions more closely, we would have discovered that we're just working with simple addition (`conjoin`) and multiplication (`breed`).

好了， 这次我们使用更少的代码得到了正确的答案。就是内嵌的函数有点让人迷惑（我们将在第五章进行修正）。这个更好，让我们看的更深一点，优势是显而易见的。通过仔细的进一步观察我们的自定义函数，发现我们仅仅用到了简单的加法（conjoin）和乘法（breed）。

There's really nothing special at all about these two functions other than their names. Let's rename our custom functions to `multiply` and `add` in order to reveal their true identities.

这两个函数除了名字之外，没有什么特别之处。让我们将其重命名为“乘”和“加”，以显示它们的真实目的。

```js
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

const flockA = 4;
const flockB = 2;
const flockC = 0;
const result =
    add(multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockC)), multiply(flockA, flockB));
// 16
```
And with that, we gain the knowledge of the ancients:

通过这些，我们可以引申出基本知识。

```js
// associative 结合律
add(add(x, y), z) === add(x, add(y, z));

// commutative 交换律
add(x, y) === add(y, x);

// identity 0元
add(x, 0) === x;

// distributive 分配律
multiply(x, add(y,z)) === add(multiply(x, y), multiply(x, z));
```

Ah yes, those old faithful mathematical properties should come in handy. Don't worry if you didn't know them right off the top of your head. For a lot of us, it's been a while since we learned about these laws of arithmetic. Let's see if we can use these properties to simplify our little seagull program.

是的， 这些经典的数学理论信手拈来。不过一时想不起也没关系。对于大多数人而言，学习这些算法的规则已经很长时间了。让我们看看能否用这些方法简化下我们的海鸥算法。

```js
// Original line
add(multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockC)), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// Apply the identity property to remove the extra add
// (add(flockA, flockC) == flockA)
add(multiply(flockB, flockA), multiply(flockA, flockB));

// Apply distributive property to achieve our result
multiply(flockB, add(flockA, flockA));
```

Brilliant! We didn't have to write a lick of custom code other than our calling function. We include `add` and `multiply` definitions here for completeness, but there is really no need to write them - we surely have an `add` and `multiply` provided by some existing library.
优秀，除了我们的调用函数外，我们无需编写一些自定义代码。完整起见，我们定义了 “add” 和 “multiply” 定义，但实际上完全没有必要，有一些现成的库会提供“ add”和“ multiply”的功能

You may be thinking "how very strawman of you to put such a mathy example up front". Or "real programs are not this simple and cannot be reasoned about in such a way." I've chosen this example because most of us already know about addition and multiplication, so it's easy to see how math is very useful for us here.
你可能正在想“这样的数学题目是不是太小儿科了”或者“真是的代码是不会如此简单的的，这种推理行不通”。之所以选择这个例子是因为我们非常熟悉加法和乘法，同时也看到数学是非常有用的。

Don't despair - throughout this book, we'll sprinkle in some category theory, set theory, and lambda calculus and write real world examples that achieve the same elegant simplicity and results as our flock of seagulls example. You needn't be a mathematician either. It will feel natural and easy, just like you were using a "normal" framework or API.
不要失望。通过本书，我们将会简单介绍一些范畴论，集合论和微积分知识，来编写一个与上面海鸥事例同样简单的真实例子。不必想像成一个数学家，就像使用常见的框架或者API一样轻松自然。

It may come as a surprise to hear that we can write full, everyday applications along the lines of the functional analog above. Programs that have sound properties. Programs that are terse, yet easy to reason about. Programs that don't reinvent the wheel at every turn. Lawlessness is good if you're a criminal, but in this book, we'll want to acknowledge and obey the laws of math.
听到要使用上述函数是思维编写一个完整的日常的应用，一个会说话的程序，精练但易懂的程序，不会重复的程序，是不可思议的。无拘无束是罪犯的心理，但是本书中，我们将严格遵守数据规律。

We'll want to use a theory where every piece tends to fit together so politely. We'll want to represent our specific problem in terms of generic, composable bits and then exploit their properties for our own selfish benefit. It will take a bit more discipline than the "anything goes" approach of imperative programming (we'll go over the precise definition of "imperative" later in the book, but for now consider it anything other than functional programming). The payoff of working within a principled, mathematical framework will truly astound you.
我们将利用一种理论来优雅的组合各种元素。使用泛型和可组合的计算描述问题，抽象能为我所用的属性。这比“什么都执行”的命令式编程（本书最后有对命令式编程的详细说明，这里可以认为除了函数式编程的所有）有更多的数学框架内约束，但是这样带来的效益也是可观的。

We've seen a flicker of our functional northern star, but there are a few concrete concepts to grasp before we can really begin our journey.
我们已经看到了函数式的北极星在闪烁，但是在真正开始旅程之前，需要掌握一些具体概念。
